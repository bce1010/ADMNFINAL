<h1>Donations For a Cause </h1>
<p> History:
		This ourganization founded by Ben Errington was origionally created in 2006 when he was able to start a funding for his idea that after teachers are done with usable classroom tools they should be donated to third world countires to help with their education process. 
	 </p>
<h3>Where we started & Now </h3>
	<p2> In 2006 Donations For a Cause was ran out of a small shipping center we had by partnering with elemenrty through highschool districts and asking them to donate instead of throw out old materials so we can ship them to countries in need ourselves.</p2>
	<p3> Now in 2002 we have a partnership with UPS and we are able to take in much bigger donations like chairs and desks which helps so much more with bringing a foundation of a clasroom into countries that need them. </p3>
